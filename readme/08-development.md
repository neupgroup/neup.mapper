# Build & Local Development

To build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs are generated to `dist/` with type declarations.

## Testing

You can use the `testapp` directory to verify changes locally.

1.  Navigate to `testapp/`.
2.  Update the `page.tsx` or other files to use your local changes.
3.  Run the test app (e.g., `npm run dev`).
